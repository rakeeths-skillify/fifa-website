<ul>
  <li>
    Adding more pressure towards the French revolution, this is Mbappes time to
    shine- He has been sagging off the first half, and hopefully can regain the
    motivation and momemtum required to equalize or solely capitalize
  </li>
  <li>
    Argeninas superior first half defense may have deteriorated and will make it
    more arduous for them to keep the same pace and pressure for the second half
  </li>
